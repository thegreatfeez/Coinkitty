üöÄ Project 1: Crypto Portfolio Tracker (Without Wallet Integration)

A web app where users can search, track, and simulate their crypto holdings.

Features to Build

Homepage ‚Äì Show a list of top cryptocurrencies (using a free API like CoinGecko
).

Search Functionality ‚Äì Let users search for a crypto by name/symbol.

Crypto Details Page ‚Äì Clicking a coin shows details: price, market cap, 24h change, chart (fetch historical data).

Add to Portfolio ‚Äì User can input how much of a coin they ‚Äúown‚Äù (saved in state or localStorage).

Portfolio Page ‚Äì Show all saved coins with total balance and P/L calculation.

Protected Route ‚Äì Portfolio page only accessible after login (mock login with React Context or simple auth state).

Performance Optimizations ‚Äì Use useMemo, React.memo, useCallback for re-renders when data changes.

What You‚Äôll Practice

Fetching and rendering API data.

State management & controlled forms (adding crypto amounts).

Routing + protected routes (login/portfolio).

Context for global state (portfolio across pages).

Code splitting & memoization for performance.

Real-world Web3 relevance (crypto tracking).
